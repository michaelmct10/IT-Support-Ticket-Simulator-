# IT Support Ticket Simulator

A small Python console app that simulates a basic IT support ticket workflow.

## Features
- Create tickets (title, requester, priority)
- List tickets
- Update ticket status (Open / In Progress / Closed)
- Add update notes with timestamps
- View full ticket history

## Why this project
I built this to demonstrate structured problem solving, clear documentation, and ticket-based workflow thinking (similar to real IT support environments).

## How to run
```bash
python src/main.py
